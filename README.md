# Dry-Beans
This project is a classification task that aims to predict the type of dry beans based on their physical features. The dataset used in this project contains seven different types of dry beans (Sira, Dermosan, Horoz, Cali, Seker, Barbunya, and Bomba) and their physical attributes, such as length, area, perimeter, etc.

Dataset --

The dataset used in this project consists of 13611 instances and 17 features, including 16 physical characteristics of the dry beans and the target variable, which represents the type of dry bean.

Methods --

The project uses various machine learning algorithms to predict the type of dry beans. The algorithms used in this project include:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine
The performance of these models is evaluated using various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Installation --

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You also need to install the following libraries:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Usage --

To run the project, you can simply clone the repository and run the main Python script. The main script loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains and evaluates the models, and saves the results in a CSV file.

Results
The results of the project show that the Support Vector Machine algorithm performs the best in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The project achieves an accuracy of 93.24 % on the test set using the Support Vector algorithm.

Conclusion --

The dry beans classification project demonstrates how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the type of dry beans based on their physical attributes. The project shows that the Support Vector Machine algorithm performs the best in terms of accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
